This package provides `HttpPlusClient` which is `BaseClient` (
of [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http)) implementation that supports `HTTP/2` and fallbacks to
`HTTP/1.1` if the server does not support it. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement
of `HttpClient`.

> This is built on top of [`http2_client`](https://pub.dev/packages/http2_client) package, which is no longer maintained.

This package is in active development.
___Any contribution, idea, criticism or feedback is welcomed.___
